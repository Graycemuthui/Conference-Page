        <p class="header-para">
          SawaSawa Fashion Week is a yearly event that brings together creatives
          to meet, network and ofcourse gain more knowledge in the fashion
          industry. This happens in different countries each year. It was
          created with a purpose of letting each and every creative share their
          work and share their opinions freely. However this year we have
          decided to host it in the country where it all started i.e Nairobi,
          Kenya. We have decided to add more numbers to the guest list as you
          know for the past years we only had a particular number of guests.
          This year will be a new beginning as we target to bring in more ideal
          speakers and the program entails so much learning in the process.
